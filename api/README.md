# API

Functions in this library are grouped by three categories:

- [Builder](/api/builder)
  - Functions which generate color (32 bit integer) from various inputs (`input -> Color`).
- [Converter](/api/converter)
  - Functions which convert the color into another format (`Color -> output`, `output` represents the color).
- [Getter](/api/getter)
  - Functions which get values from the color (`Color -> value`).
- [Manipulator](/api/manipulator)
  - Functions which take color and return another color based on inputs (`Color -> Color`).
